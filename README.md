# Capacity
Our web-based application, currently named Capacity, is a tool that will help you save time by giving you the information you wish you had before getting to your destination. Our website can be found here: https://ssajnani.github.io/Capacity/homepage.html

## Repository Structure
Our repository structure is seperated under frontend and backend, both developed in javascript. The backend uses node, express, and mongodb. The frontend uses vue. The frontend files are already compiled into the backend public folder so setup is easier.

## Setup
LINUX:
Navigate to ./capbackend and type `bash ./run` to install the dependencies for ubuntu. Otherwise, you can manually type the commands from the script yourself. 
Navigate to localhost:3000 on your browser to load the website and start using Capacity!
